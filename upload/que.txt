1. Find earthquakes between range _ _ 
select * from eqs where latitude between 13 and 63 and longitude between -150 and -97

2. How many earth quakes between magnitude __ :
select * from eqs where mag between 1.5 and 4

3.Number of earthquakes in a CA 
select * from eqs where place like '%CA'
 
4.Number of earthquakes on a particular day


select distinct dayname(time) from eqs
select * from eqs where dayname(time)='sunday';

5.Eartquakes within 10 degrees of our current location
select * from eqs where latitude between 13 and 63 and longitude between -150 and -97

6.Cleaning data:
if data type is text : delete from eqs where gap =''
if data type is varchar : delete from eqs where gap is null;
fr paticular value:delete from eqs where longitude=99


7. Number of earthquakes in a particular city of magnitude between _ and _
 select Count(*) from eqs where place like '%Hawaii' and mag between 0 and 4

19:21:24	SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0	0 row(s) affected	0.047 sec


8. The highest number of time earthquake has occured amougnst all magnitudes magnitude 
select mag,count(*) as count from eqs group by mag  order by count desc limit 1

9.Place query different formats:



placeQuery = "select * from quakes where place Like '%s' or place like '%s'" %(str(place1),str(place2))

query3 = "select * from quakes where place Like '%"+place1+"' or place like '%"+place2+"'"

"select Count(*) from quakes123 where place like '"+ p +"' or place like  '%Alaska' "



11.select * from equakes1 where latitude!='' and longitude!='' and 
( 3959 * acos( cos( radians(13.5776) ) * cos( radians( 13.5776 ) )
 * cos( radians( -91.3198 ) - radians(" -91.3198 ") ) + sin( radians(13.5776) ) 
 * sin( radians( 13.5776 ) ) ) ) < 5


12.update quakes set nst='0' where nst = ''


13. Random queries:
select * from quakes where mag between (select min(mag) from quakes) and (select max(mag) from quakes) having place like '%Alaska';
select * from quakes;
select count(*) from quakes where place like '%CA' or place like '%Alaska' or place like '%Oklahoma';
select * from quakes where time(time) between time('00:00:00') and time('01:00:00');
select * from quakes where time(time) LIMIT 1 ;
select * from quakes where DAY(time) between day('2016-05-01') and day('2016-05-01');
select count(*) from quakes;
select * from quakes where dayname(time)='Sunday' ;
select count(*),place from quakes where mag>2.5 group by place ;
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;
update quakes set mag=100 where latitude >59 and latitude<60;

Time and Date queries: 

select * from test1 where DAY(time)=DAY('2016-05-02');
select time from test1 where time like '%21:49:38%';
